It\u2019s good to make a promotion of football in the Philippines to get people interested in football. There\u2019s a lot of great players in each team, and it\u2019s always a fun game to watch. https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","50":"Mara\u00f1on: The Clasico is the best game ever that you can watch around the world. There is no other game that can compare to them. Even if they don\u2019t like football, if they watch El Clasico, they will enjoy and they will like football from there. https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","51":"Del Rosario: If you want to watch the best players in the world play, this is the game you gotta watch. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","52":"Del Rosario on the importance of El Clasico to Philippine football: When it comes down to football, it\u2019s two of the top teams in the world. Real Madrid and Barcelona will be on everybody\u2019s top 5 list. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","53":"De Murga: I\u2019ll have to go for Messi. How he dominated not just scoring goals, also just assisting. Even though all the great players who went through Barcelona and Real Madrid, I\u2019d say Messi and Ronaldo help each other to become better. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","54":"Del Rosario: He\u2019s always been so cool on the ball. But I just want to see being on the field with him because he makes everything look so much easier than it is\u2026. That guy is just magic. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","55":"Del Rosario: When it comes down to players, one from Real Madrid that I\u2019d probably choose would be Zidane. He\u2019s one of the greatest players I\u2019ve ever seen play. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","56":"Mara\u00f1on: He was the best player of the world for many years. It\u2019s amazing how he and Messi fight to be the best for how many years. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","57":"\u201cIf you were to choose a player in the history of El Clasico, who will you import to play alongside with?\u201d\n\nMara\u00f1on: If I have to choose one, for me it\u2019s Cristiano. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","58":"De Murga: On top of that, one of my favorite players of Barcelona is Andres Iniesta, which other things that they achieved together are not just in Barcelona but also for the national team. I cannot choose just one player. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","59":"De Murga: I cannot say also I have a favorite player out of all. To me I think that Messi is the GOAT. I\u2019ve never seen people do what Messi does. He plays with professionals like he\u2019s playing against kids. And you\u2019ve never seen that kind of superiority in the history of football.","60":"Mara\u00f1on: I don\u2019t really have a favorite. I like Cristiano because he gives Real Madrid too many things, not only goals. He makes the teams afraid when they play against Madrid, only because Cristiano was playing.","61":"Del Rosario: I\u2019m talking about Salgado, Roberto Carlos, Hierro, Raoul and all of those guys. That was my favorite time of Real Madrid and that\u2019s when they dominated the LaLiga and dominated Barcelona. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","62":"Del Rosario talks about his favorite El Clasico player: My favorite through the years is Sergio Ramos, especially his earlier years. The earlier years were where I was bigger fan of Real Madrid. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","63":"Del Rosario: No matter what the score is, you get to see these two teams, who are top teams, go at it for a special reason. It\u2019s always much better to see rivals play against each other and that\u2019s what makes it so special. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","64":"Who else is excited for 'Wildest Dreams'? :star-struck: https:\/\/t.co\/yYftp8VxaH","65":"Del Rosario: My favorite Clasico game could\u2019ve been 2014. Benzema had 2 goals, Cristiano had 1. We ended up winning 3-2. It was a very exciting game. But when it comes down to it, I think any El Clasico is a great game. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","66":"De Murga: My favorite moment I would say is like the 6-2 win in Bernabeu (2009) in favor of Barcelona. That was a very well-played game for Barcelona. And the 5-1 I watched live. Probably the best moment I\u2019ve seen Barcelona against Real Madrid. https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZEeRb","67":"Mara\u00f1on: That would be my best times \u2013 every single game Cristiano plays against them. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","68":"Mara\u00f1on: Every time Cristiano is there, Barcelona suffers a lot, they were afraid of him, these are the times I enjoy El Clasico \u2013 in all these crowded stadiums and Cristiano in front, Barcelona were suffering a lot. (1\/2) #RapplerTalk","69":"Mara\u00f1on on his most memorable El Clasico game: I can\u2019t choose only one, especially every time Cristiano Ronaldo in Barcelona scores goal, that for me would be one of the most memorable games.  #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","70":"The film stars Paulo Avelino as a creepy version of himself, and Charlie Dizon as his obsessed fan.\n\nWatch the trailer here: https:\/\/t.co\/p0K0kLVO0W","71":"De Murga: Messi didn\u2019t play that game, I wanted to see him play live. But at least Barcelona won. It was a very good experience. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","72":"De Murga shares his experience of watching El Clasico live: I watched it once, in Camp Nou  in Barcelona, and Barcelona won 5-1. It was very nice experience\u2026. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","73":"Del Rosario: I definitely have plans to go visit Spain once all this clears up. I want to catch some of my roots. My mom, she\u2019s half-Spanish, so I definitely want to go and see the hometown where she\u2019s from. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","74":"Del Rosario says he hopes to see El Clasico live: I wish, it\u2019s always been one of my dreams. It\u2019s definitely a bucketlist. I\u2019ll make it out there one day to catch one of these El Clasico, hopefully for a title game, too. It makes it much more exciting. https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","75":"Mara\u00f1on: I recommend to everybody not to only watch in the TV, but you also have to go there to watch the game in the stadium. It\u2019s totally different. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","76":"Mara\u00f1on shares his experiences of watching El Clasico live: I was watching in the stadium, two of them. One time, Real Madrid won, and another time Real Madrid drew. But both of them, I enjoyed a lot. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","77":"De Murga: Barcelona was kind of like having a golden era at that time. We just fell in love with the philosophy, how they play. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","78":"Junior de Murga on supporting FC Barcelona: My uncle, he\u2019s a huge Barcelona fan, and all our cousins became Barcelona supporters because of him. We became supporters at the age of Johan Cruyff, who was the coach of Barcelona. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","79":"Anton del Rosario on Real Madrid: They were always my first team to ever fall in love with, they will always be one of the teams that are dear to my heart. #RapplerTalk https:\/\/t.co\/SgGrtZmDsB","80":"Bienve Mara\u00f1on on supporting Real Madrid: I\u2019m so happy to be a supporter.
