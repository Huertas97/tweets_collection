The panelists' opinions differed: \n\n- It depends on your mission and your audience\u2014have a good grasp of both\n\n- It's our role as journalists to record the first draft of history rather than facilitate it","2":"\"We vote not for ourselves but for society as a whole and for our future. Democracy is something we all do for our collective community.\" - @Nedfoley","3":"\"A voting process that is flawed in some respect isn't a failed process.\"\n\n@Nedfoley warns journalists: \"If you isolate the flaws, you may miss the fact that the system may produce the right outcome in the aggregate.\"","4":"\"So many of our constitutional ideals and values are protected not by laws but by norms\u2014and the same is true for our voting rights... This is worth exploring.\" - @AlexanderAbdo","5":"\"Be proactive about explaining what you're there to do, who you trust, what your process is, what the ethics are, and why you stand behind what you're saying.\" - @mayerjoy","6":"\"Think about the communities who are vulnerable to the policies that will be made by the next administration and actually talk to them.\" - @gabemschneider","7":".@noUpside says local news is more trusted than national news and thus is well positioned to cover election information and misinformation.","8":"\"If you don't have people set to read comments next week, you're ceding your power to people who will be attacking your coverage.\"\n\n@mayerjoy says newsrooms should have a strategy for taking information and feedback in, not just disseminating them.","9":"\"If people aren't sure what your motivations are, they don't give journalists the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\n@mayerjoy urges journalists to explain why you do\u2014or don't do\u2014something.","10":"\"The overall numbers of people who say they trust in the media actually hasn't changed much over the last few years.\n\n73% of Democrats have strong levels of trust in media.\nOnly 10% of Republicans do.\n\nThe question of trust comes down to who trusts.\" - @mayerjoy of @TrustingNews","11":"\"We don't think enough as an industry on the impact our work can have. We think a lot about the production of it.\" - @gabemschneider","12":"\"I don't think you can be neutral when these photos are going to end up in a police database.\"\n\n- @gabemschneider on the serious ethical issues related to coverage of political issues","13":"\"Diversity in your political coverage is critical... if you actually want to cover politics.\" \n\n@gabemschneider points out that when the summer protests were happening, political reporters, who are overwhelmingly white, male, and cis, weren't ready to write about them.","14":"\"The new jurisprudence coming from the Supreme Court is not at all sympathetic to the decades of precedent... They're rethinking all of federal election law.\n\nWe are in the midst of plate tectonic shifts. The ground really is shifting underneath us all.\" - @Nedfoley #election2020","15":"No matter who says what, \"the election isn't finished on election night.\" - @Nedfoley \n\nAccording to the law, the election isn't official until the Electoral College meets. That date is December 14.","16":"\"I can almost guarantee we will see [down ballot] litigation.\" \n\nWhile many of us assume any election litigation issue will relate to the presidency, @Nedfoley urges us to remember issues could, and most likely will, arise in congressional races too.","17":"When it comes to the pandemic and #election2020, images &amp; stories of the coronavirus are serving as a demotivator for voting.\n\nKEY POINT: Journalists need to recognize the real threats and contextualize the provisions at the polls\u2014help people understand the mechanics of voting","18":"Another growing trend in misinformation: the \"blue check phenomenon.\"\n\nThis is where large influencers spread misinformation through their much wider networks and audiences, which goes much farther than any Russian bot or other actors.","19":"Are foreign agents a major player in US election misinformation?\n\n@noUpside says: \"most are domestically sourced and propagated.\"","20":"\"Narratives are rarely confined to one platform.\" - @noUpside. Compared to the 2016 election, this year we are facing:\n\n- Determined factors working in concert to push out narratives on their candidate\n\n- New tools, especially things like live video\n\n- Emergence of new platforms","21":"Election Day\/Week\/Month(??) can go any number of ways, &amp; today we're exploring the most likely scenarios with a team of election &amp; law experts.\n\nFollow along here to get the highlights from today's conversation w\/ @noUpside, @Nedfoley, @AlexanderAbdo, @gabemschneider, &amp; @mayerjoy","22":"Happening today at 3pm EDT!
