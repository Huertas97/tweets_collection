That\u2019s why some misinfo spreaders pose as local sites to push lies (@ pink slime news). \n\nIt\u2019s important to know what\u2019s a reliable source in your community. And be careful when you look to local sites in other communities for info. https:\/\/t.co\/scFGUBexAG","1":"The next thing you should look for are editorial standards and a corrections policy. \n\nNewspapers that publicly lay out their ethical standards and policies for acknowledging when they get things wrong are more credible. \n\nKnow who doesn\u2019t have either? The Buffalo Chronicle. https:\/\/t.co\/PpMoTGhAVp","2":"BTW, sometimes sources go anonymous. That\u2019s okay in certain contexts, like when a source provides important, sensitive info.\n\nApproach anonymity with caution and look to the reputation of the source when it\u2019s used. @FiveThirtyEight has some tips on that:\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/KtHk09MuI5","3":"Then dig into the text of the article. Look for clear evidence and identifiable sources.\n\nThere\u2019s none of that in this piece! That\u2019s a big \u2018ol red flag. Those sure are adding up, huh? https:\/\/t.co\/iwtvtMbFj0","4":"Next, give the article a look. First stop: the byline.\n\nA journalist puts their credibility on the line when their name is on a story. Look to see who wrote the story, and what they\u2019ve written before (to make sure they\u2019re legit). \n\nThere\u2019s no byline here. Preettttyyy sketchyyyy. https:\/\/t.co\/yag2nhdK8q","5":"Next, look at what trusted outlets say about the source. \n\nA keyword search pulled up articles from @PolitiFact and @BuzzFeedNews debunking the Romney cabinet story. Both said the story was false, and BuzzFeed added that the site has pushed false info before: https:\/\/t.co\/psuDpGmJHm","6":"First, check @Wikipedia.\n\nForget what you heard, it can be a good starting point for fact-checking. There isn\u2019t a page for \u201cBuffalo Chronicle,\u201d which is a huge red flag. But know where the site did show up? On this \u201cList of fake news websites\u201d Wiki page.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/v2he8VflTh","7":"Local outlets are some of the most reliable news sources. Some sites exploit that by posing as local news.\n\n@JaneLyTv checked a story from one such site. The Buffalo Chronicle falsely claimed @JoeBiden asked @MittRomney to join his cabinet.\n\nTips to spot trusted local journalism:
