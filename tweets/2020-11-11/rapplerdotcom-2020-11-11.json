And I want the movement to be able to see itself because it's already way bigger than the technology companies.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","139":"Harris: ...and the possibility that we have 40 million to 50 million people around the world \u2013 which is bigger than the civil rights movement, or the gay rights movement \u2013 potentially to really drive change. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","140":"Harris: As many years as you and I've been both working on this, I've never felt more hopeful than I do right now, with the combination of a Biden administration getting elected and our ability to reform the tech companies\u2026\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","141":"Harris: I do think that the one thing people should realize is, the more people understand this problem, the faster it will change. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","142":"Harris: Even though it's great that people can go viral and hopefully spread positive messages, I think we have to really reckon with the intrinsic unsafety of the system, especially in places where the companies don't have a level of attention or integrity teams or ICU beds.","143":"Harris: And frankly, we need to put pressure on the tech companies to radically change and minimize the unchecked virality that is intrinsically unsafe and toxic.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","144":"Harris: And we will also be affected by those who don't choose healing, so it really is about a global consciousness that we have to raise. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLyH3ZT","145":"Harris: If we don't each individually do that, the system will continue to reward that. And then even if every single person watching this right now chose healing over more conflict, there would still be other people who don't. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","146":"Harris: Ask yourself, \u201cWhy am I posting this? What will I get from this?\u201d, and choose healing over conflict, choose de-escalation over escalation. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","147":"Harris: So if we're going to be forced to use it, we have to use it with incredible skepticism and cynicism, that most of the comments that you see, if they're not from a close friend, just assume that they're completely made up. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","148":"Harris: We have to be self-aware of that\u2026. [In] the Philippines, one of the reasons that the usage is so high is that the connections people have to the rest of the world, people have to use Facebook. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","149":"Harris: With our work, [we] are trying to reform social media and all these technology companies, and we still have to use it because they monopolized the mechanism by which we can reach other people. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","150":"Harris: I think the first thing is to recognize the intrinsic toxicity and verifiability of this system. I think people just have to realize that as much as this is the only way to reach large numbers of people\u2026\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","151":"Harris: No matter how much that costs, they are trillion dollar corporations, Facebook and Google. They can afford this, and we have to make sure that they pay for the harms that are showing up on society's balance sheet, not their own.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","152":"Harris: They bring on these other users from these other developing countries, it's going to cost them more per user than it did for the early stages of their growth, so we have to put that cost on them. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","153":"Harris: What's going to happen is the growth is going to come from other countries, in which the cost for an Ethiopian user is way higher, because I have to hire content moderators in countries [that] don't have the language coverage. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","154":"Harris: And most of Facebook's growth has already taken place in the major Western democracies. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","155":"Harris: And the important fact for you also is, if you think about the cost to protect an English-speaking user in a Western democracy, the cost of that is kind of lower because they have these content moderation firms that know how to deal with that. \n https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","156":"Harris: But we have no other choice at this point for them to, at the very least, try to protect every single nation, and to not even allow them to go into nations where they are not equipped to protect them.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","157":"Harris: That's what's become the problem \u2013  they are unelected, authoritarian managers of the global consciousness. I'm not a fan of making them the global state department for managing the national security of the world. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","158":"Former PBA player Ronald Pascual is \"somewhere in Metro Manila moving from one house to another, staying with whoever accepts him,\" says his brother.  https:\/\/t.co\/jaP42Kiggx","159":"Harris: Do we want Facebook to be the one in charge of all this, and be building a state department that manages whose interest are they representing for the whole world?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","160":"Harris: One of the issues is they have to spend billions more dollars on being kind of a state department for the world. Now, you have to ask, is that what we really want? \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","161":"Harris: Now, when Azerbaijan or the Philippines or Myanmar need help, it only has so many researchers and resources and data scientists and people on the integrity teams to deal with these threats.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","162":"Harris: Recently, with the US elections, it's devoted most of its resources in the election war room to the United States, which is this huge blob of a country that's sitting on top of a very small number of ICU beds. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","163":"Harris: Everyone knows now, the flatten the curve thing, there's only so many ICU beds. And so we have to make sure we keep the number of people that are infected low. Facebook only has so many ICU beds for the nations that have been attacked. \n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","164":"Harris: And you're only as good as the number of people that Facebook has hired to deal with the national security of that country. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","165":"Harris: Because when you protect your physical borders, and you have passport controls, once you install Facebook in your society, you just opened the border to anyone, because they can walk right across. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","166":"Harris: The United States will spend trillions of dollars on their nuclear arsenal, and F-35s. Meanwhile, they left their digital border wide open. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","167":"Harris: This is a climate change-scale problem that we need climate change-scale solutions. On the national security side, we have to realize that there is a new information war that's happening. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","168":"Ressa: ...and was starting a campaign for the presidential elections of President Duterte\u2019s daughter. So we already see it coming. How do we get to a more ideal or safer place from where we are?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","169":"Ressa: We haven't even talked about the countries that are manipulating us \u2013 Russia, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia. Facebook took down on September 22 a Chinese network that was attacking us and was pro-China\u2026\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","170":"Harris to Ressa: And the fact that your reputation and what people even believe about your situation is the product of what random people post and gets the most clicks, and what people can assert without you being able to respond. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","171":"Harris to Ressa: I wish the tech industry acted a lot faster over the last few years. And I'm really sorry that everything you've had to deal with personally, in all of this.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","172":"LOOK: Yet to fully recover, #RollyPH-hit Naga City prepares its Incident Management Team ahead of #UlyssesPH on Wednesday, November 11. Photos from Mayor Son Legacion. | via @AlzelLaguardia\n\n#UlyssesPH UPDATES: https:\/\/t.co\/fVarJMRl6r https:\/\/t.co\/F0ELpzdUKZ","173":"Harris: Personally speaking, I spend time with a very small community, and that really does help us heal and not get sucked into all of these things, because you find it more ridiculous, and you don't trust it as much.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","174":"Harris: And especially in a COVID world where we're more isolated and we can't spend time together, it makes us even more vulnerable to these effects.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","175":"Harris: We are living in a mind-body meatsuit, you know, that needs touch, we need affection, we need eye contact, we need connection, and social media profits from the screen-based version of that, which is not the same as the fulfilling in-person thing.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","176":"Harris: I imagine this is a little bit of a nonlinear solution, but if each of us had deep connection, deep community and deep love \u2013 because we actually got that in the real world. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","177":"Harris: And what actually helped them get out of it was that they got a girlfriend, because it turns out, what we're really seeking is connection and meaning and love. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","178":"Harris: And again, I think we can change this, if we realize what heals us. I was talking with a friend recently about someone they knew who was radicalized previously by one of these sort of alt-right groups online. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","179":"Harris: And the less you want to engage with real people, because they don't see the world the way you see it\u2026. And so the more you get radicalized, and it's sort of a self-rewarding, reinforcing process.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","180":"Harris: So the more Ben [in \u2018The Social Dilemma\u2019] gets isolated, it's sort of a cascading effect \u2013 the more isolated you are, the more vulnerable you are to conspiracy thinking, because you're not interacting with real people. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","181":"Harris: And those are layered effects. The business model of attention and engagement doesn't just profit from hate and conspiracy theories. It also profits from addiction in isolation. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","182":"Ressa: That machine knows Ben better.... So this machine radicalizes us, isolates us, strangely enough, right?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","183":"Ressa: Actually, the more dehumanization, the more \u201cotherness\u201d, the more money the platforms make. So in \u2018The Social Dilemma,\u2019 you actually show the creation of Ben the machine, from data. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","184":"Researchers say the number of those who tested positive for COVID-19 in Metro Manila 'has gone down significantly' and is now at 5% \u2013 the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended rate. https:\/\/t.co\/qrkfU4V7vG","185":"Ressa: Shoshana Zuboff wrote a 750-page book on surveillance capitalism, that all of the  problems we've identified stem from a business model that incentivizes hate \u2013 the more hate, the more anger, the more conspiracy theories. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","186":"@maracepeda Cayetano also recounts meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte, where his rival and now Speaker Lord Allan Velasco supposedly told the President that he wants Phisgoc probed for anomalies. | via @maracepeda","187":"Harris: And we need social media, changing the design norms, and the ways that it promotes certain options and choices to enable healing first. Instead of America first, let's have healing first.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","188":"Harris: We can either choose to do that, or we can choose to heal and de-escalate, but that means everyone has to choose that. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","189":"Harris: And in that society, we can keep escalating towards civil conflict and then moving towards civil war. But that's not going to result in a [better] world. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","190":"Harris: I think that's the benefit \u2018The Social Dilemma\u2019 accomplishes, it shows how it's not that the left is wrong, or that the right is wrong. It's that the entire system is made [where] each of us see the worst parts of each other. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","191":"Harris: I think we have to ask really deeper, even more fundamental questions, which is recognizing that this is a machine that has hypnotized us into hating each other. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","192":"Harris: Even if I look at, again, the most intellectual and accomplished people at the tops of our society, they still participate on Twitter in sort of nasty toddler-like ways \u2013 and I don't just mean Donald Trump, I mean people on all sides. \n https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","193":"Harris: So if we make the platforms responsible, we run into that issue. If we make users responsible, we know that users really just don't act responsibly. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","194":"Harris: But then they're wondering why they got censored. It's driving up huge amounts of polarization in countries, because then people think, \u201cI'm getting censored.\u201d\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","195":"Harris: Facebook, in many cases, [has] taken down or at least [is] restricting some of the distribution of inauthentic speech, and in the process, it is bundled with some who may be good actors who are not bots.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","196":"Harris: And then if the Republicans don't like the way that they censor certain people, you can drive up even more polarization, political wars, which is exactly what we're having in the United States right now. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","197":"Harris: So we can put the responsibility on the platform for, let's say, the most highly distributed pieces of content, but then people will get upset at them, because now they are the arbiters of speech. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","198":"Harris: How do you verify that people will use it in good faith and act like responsible, not-yellow journalists, sort-of gatekeepers? That is a problem that I don't think we know how to solve. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","199":"Harris: If we add a gating function there, we say we're going to require something that verifies you are who you say you are. That's one way of verifying authentic use, but then you could still have authentic people who are using it inauthentic ways.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","200":"Harris: One of the problems is we have bad faith usage, because we don't have real people that are using them. We have bot farms. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","201":"Harris: One is that Facebook shut down, I think, 2 billion fake accounts in one 3-month period. And if they shut down 2 billion fake accounts, I\u2019m pretty sure they didn't get all of the right ones, right?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","202":"Harris: I think we're narrowing in on a few things here. So for example, if we try to solve it bottom-up, then as you said, we need to verify good faith participants, we think about different ways of doing that. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","203":"Harris: I think one way to think about this is, how would you feel if your ex-romantic partner was on the TV screen of a huge football stadium, and they could say anything they wanted without accountability? That's exactly what we have created.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","204":"Harris: If I'm not acting in that way, I probably don't deserve the privilege of freedom of reach. And as we say, freedom of reach is not the same as freedom of speech. We are not all given a god-given right to a state football stadium-sized audience. \n https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","205":"Harris: I can reach as many people as a small TV station or a newspaper could, just 20 years ago, but now I have to act like a newspaper or a broadcast TV station and have the responsibility of that. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","206":"Harris: I think that's a real thing we have to reckon with, so how do we do it? We either have to each have the power of godlike psychological influence, we can broadcast, each of us, to as many people.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","207":"Harris: Anyone, everyone in our society is participating that way. The impossibilities still stand, because those people will always get more attention than the calm, level-headed people who say very little.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","208":"Harris: Which means, if you look on social media right after the US elections, you see some of the top people in our society, still yelling with outrage, still yelling basically \u201cneener neener neener.\u201d\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","209":"Harris: It's giving us sort of \u201csocietal jaundice,\u201d we're all turning yellow\u2026. We have to be able to take the entire participant body of people participating in social media, and not participate as yellow journalists.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","210":"Harris: Now you can think of what's happening with social media as decentralized yellow journalism \u2013 each of us are actually incentivized, with more rewards, more likes, and more hearts, the more yellow you get.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","211":"Harris: But the problem is, we saw in the 1800s, in the United States, yellow journalism, and it almost got us into a war. And we had to invent media ethics and journalism to prevent that from happening again. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","212":"Harris: A system in which incentives and money and attention and rewards flow to the loudest, most angry bully, is not a system that will ever reward good faith \u2013 unless people don't act like bullies, and they act like responsible journalists. \n https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","213":"Harris: The more you are a toddler, and the more you yell, and the more you scream, the more attention, rewards, likes, followers, comments you will get. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","214":"Harris: Here's the problem \u2013 each of us, every single person who posts on social media is now a \u201cmicro gatekeeper\u201d for contributing to a reality, except we are not acting like gatekeepers. We are acting like toddlers.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","215":"Harris: You know, that ethical discernment that says, \u201cShould I do this or not? What will happen if I put attention on this?\u201d That's the job of the gatekeeper. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","216":"Harris: And you said on [a] podcast about how the government had called you and they wanted you to put the cameras on them, but you actually withheld the cameras, because you knew that that would enable a coup to happen.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","217":"Harris: Well, there's tech that needs to be a gatekeeper, but then there\u2019s also all of us. As you said, I mean, your work and background as a journalist, right?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","218":"Ressa: Isn\u2019t that a basic question though? I guess, because we\u2019re journalists, the gatekeepers, we're supposed to do that, because people will lie. Do you think there is enough evidence now that tech will realize it needs to be a gatekeeper?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","219":"Harris: Or whether your intentions are good, or whether you're just trying to sow dissent \u2013 is that compatible with democracy?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","220":"Harris: So the challenge is, we have to ask some really difficult questions. I think we have to ask, is a user-generated content model where anyone can post anything and it can go viral to millions of people, and we don't verify who you are\u2026\n https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","221":"Harris: That power has not been coupled with ethics or responsibility, and if you decouple the amount of power I have to influence other people from ethics responsibility or good faith usage, that decoupling fundamentally produces a toxic environment. \n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","222":"Harris: ...and not have that power, which is an exponential broadcasting power, which is now in the hands of 15-year-old girls with Instagram accounts, all the way up to dictators, all the way up to regular people who are using it\u2026\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","223":"Harris: I think we have to define this problem by the way that social media intrinsically, with user-generated content \u2013 meaning anyone can participate and post anything, and have the promise of morality that can go viral to millions of people\u2026\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","224":"Harris: A problem fully understood is a problem that is half solved, and a problem that is not fully understood is unsolvable, because it means you're not reckoning with the actual space of what that problem is. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","225":"Harris: Well, it's incredibly challenging, and as much as you and I both want to solve this immediately, I think the first step is you can't solve a problem you don't fully understand.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","226":"Ressa: And all of the people on both sides of, say Black Lives Matter, they have changed the way they look at the world because of social media. I guess, in this sense, you pointed out the problem. What's the best way you can see moving forward?\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","227":"Ressa: The design is changed, but that hate speech, conspiracy theories, seeded, that don't go viral immediately, but then change the way we think \u2013 all these things are still there.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","228":"Ressa: We know now lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further. The real Facebook Oversight Board, other groups that you and I are part of have actually already said that this is going to have to be changed.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","229":"Ressa: I mean, it is really good to see that Biden and Harris won by enough of a margin. But still, the effects are there. And we\u2019re coming up to our elections in less than two years\u2019 time. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","230":"Ressa: Of course, we know this firsthand, right? The bottom-up hatred and attacks on social media, top-down attacks mimicking the attacks on social media, and then sandwiching and killing, death by a thousand cuts, killing democracy. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","231":"Harris: That is not going to enable any democracy to make choices, because you can measure a society and its ability to communicate and coordinate with each other and make real choices together. And that's what's exactly being broken down. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","232":"Harris:  But guess what, that's the entire world, and social media has turned our information environment into an environment with grievances and cynicism and outrage and disagreeableness. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","233":"Harris: With social media, it's never been easier to build a caricature of what someone said 4 years, 2 years, [or] a month ago, and show that you're inconsistent, and then build a mob that will hate the cartoon version of you, because you\u2019re a walking contradiction. #RapplerTalk","234":"Harris: Because all of us are inconsistent, we\u2019ll say something, and we might have said something different 4 years ago. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","235":"Harris: So what I really worry about is that those conditions are still set. And even though Trump may be out of the picture, there is still a fundamental way in which social media rewards disagreement and outrage.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","236":"Harris: I think that social media has not changed the fact that, because of smartphones and social media, someone can use it in that authoritarian way where it invades your daily thoughts and feelings in this oppressive and tyrannical way. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","237":"Harris: They invade the private thoughts and feelings of the dinner table, of waking up in the morning, of driving everywhere, the big posters everywhere. That's what authoritarianism is.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","238":"Harris: I think one of the most pernicious things about the way Trump used social media is that the daily attention of the world was always on him. And this is what authoritarians do.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/sZ1qLypsBj","239":"Harris: There is still an information environment that has been broken. Because even with, say President Biden controlling the bully pulpit and setting the bandwidth, the airwaves for what millions of people will be thinking about, he won't be using it the same way. #RapplerTalk","240":"Cayetano: Once the audit is done, not only will we publish it but everyone will be able to take a look at all of the numbers.
