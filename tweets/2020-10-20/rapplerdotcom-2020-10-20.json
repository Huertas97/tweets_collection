But of course, that's going to be one of the first issues that that the new president, especially if it's Biden will have to face.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","90":"Hiebert: Foreign policy has a very low priority right now. I mean, it's, how are we going to deal with COVID? How are we going to deal with the economic crisis, race relations, just so many differences, battles over the Supreme Court and all these things.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","91":"Hiebert: I think that will be a different tone. He will not do tweets at 3:22 in the morning, that will make policy for the world, US policy to the world. He will just not be quite as sharp-elbowed as the Trump administration.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","92":"Hiebert: And I think if China is open to it, I think Biden would try to separate out things, we're really at odds here, and we're not going to negotiate a way unless you want to compromise.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","93":"Hiebert: The other is he may look for ways to cooperate with China, for example, climate change is a huge deal that affects both China and the United States. They're the two largest emitters.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","94":"Hiebert: Does he stay with the tariffs? Or does he use a different way? I don't know. But one thing I think he would do is try to work with friendly countries, rather than being America first and only country that does everything.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","95":"Hiebert: ...the use of state-owned enterprises to compete in subsidies for companies that make their trade so much more competitive and cheaper. I think he would stick with that.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","96":"Hiebert: I think if there is a President Biden, he would continue pressing China on things that irritate the United States like intellectual property rights, forced technology transfer...\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","97":"Hiebert: One thing I have to say is the mood in the United States about China has really moved in a bilateral fashion against China, even Democrats are saying very critical things of China.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","98":"Hiebert on how the results of US election will influence policy toward China, SEA: Under Trump, if he would win again, the pressure on China would likely continue, the economic pressure, the pressure on the South China Sea, the sanctions, the tariffs, that would likely continue.","99":"Hiebert: I think they want countries to be very friendly. They want countries that they want to profit from economic cooperation\u2026. And they rely on countries in Southeast Asia to provide things for the components for the global supply chain. So they really need Southeast Asia.","100":"Hiebert: It's just a tough road to hoe for China in getting involved in infrastructure. It's not that easy. And many of their predecessors of other countries have found that before them.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","101":"Hiebert: So China offers the money, but it's not very cheap. They usually start negotiating at over 4% interest, while the Japanese come in with 0.75% or something like that.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","102":"Hiebert: I have to wonder if President Duterte, [or] the foreign minister, didn't tell the Chinese in advance that they were going to do this because otherwise, they're just leaving themselves open to having more vessels sailing in and threatening Filipino exploration efforts.","103":"Hiebert: So it'll be interesting to see how China reacts to that.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","104":"Hiebert: It's going to be interesting what China does, because the Philippines wants to start exploring and exploiting oil and gas in three different blocks, including at Reed Bank, where China has shut down the Philippine operations. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","105":"Hiebert: Instead, China keeps harassing fishermen. It makes it very difficult in Scarborough Shoal, for example.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","106":"Hiebert: And I don't understand why Duterte and the Philippines and China don't move heaven and earth to get some projects going to prove to the Filipino population that being a friend of China has some merits and benefits.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","107":"Hiebert: And then they signed $24 billion in economic investments. Well, it's ironic how little of that, virtually nothing, has been implemented.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","108":"Hiebert: One thing that shocked me, Duterte in 2016, a few months after the ruling, he goes to China and he renounced his relations with the US. He went to divorce from the US and be China's friend forever.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","109":"Hiebert on how PH relations with China will unfold in the last two years of Duterte admin: I would think that China pretty much is betting that they're seeing Duterte is heading toward becoming a lame duck president.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","110":"Hiebert: But it's almost a religion in Indonesia, they have done this for so long, this very even-handed balancing between superpowers. They have that down to an art I think.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","111":"Hiebert: They did last year, sending in fishermen that are accompanied by coast guard vessels and maritime militia vessels and really harassing the Indonesians in that area looking for fish, seafood.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","112":"Thailand pro-democracy protesters look to their Hong Kong counterparts as they stage large rallies demanding reforms to the government and the powerful monarchy. \n\nCheck out today\u2019s stories from across the region on Dateline Southeast Asia. https:\/\/t.co\/UvcoEA0m13","113":"Hiebert: Indonesia is the biggest country in Southeast Asia with 260 million population. It is almost 50% of Southeast Asia's GDP. But China has really been putting pressure on Indonesia and North Natuna and regularly sending in fishermen.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","114":"Hiebert: But in other areas than the South China Sea, they are very much trying to cooperate with China and not irritate the Chinese.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","115":"Hiebert: But they try to segment the South China Sea, which they push back immensely. And that has prompted them to step up cooperation with the United States.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","116":"Hiebert: I think Vietnam has also done a pretty good job. China really puts a lot of pressure on them, they might be communist comrades, but they really have a lot of differences and China has put a lot of pressure on them.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","117":"Hiebert: And then to the US, they're looking for some military equipment. We've seen that just in over this weekend.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","118":"Hiebert: So they're looking to China for help on infrastructure and other mining projects, et cetera, and even some electrical projects, electricity projects.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","119":"Hiebert: Well, I think maybe the country that balances the most rigorously in Southeast Asia is, of course, Indonesia. They're very even-handed, they hold both of the superpowers at arm's length, and really tried to balance very closely.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","120":"Hiebert on China\u2019s invitation to Foreign Sec Locsin and China\u2019s charm offensive during the pandemic: They also were talking about vaccines. He promised to allow the Laos vaccines, but it's not clear how much he promised in the other countries. It wasn't really reported in much.","121":"Hiebert: So he probably was there to try and ensure that countries remembered China's around and tried to sort of build up morale and boost their support for China, and hoped that they would not side with the United States.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","122":"Hiebert: And the pressure that much criticism of the US have of China's stance, and it's ignoring the 2016 arbitral tribunal again, that ruled largely against China and for the Philippines.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","123":"Hiebert: But I think maybe the reason was that US has really started putting a lot of pressure on China, particularly in the South China Sea, but even on economic issues sanctioning 2 dozen Chinese companies that were involved in building artificial islands in the South China Sea","124":"Hiebert: It was also maybe to show that China was concerned that they would be willing to help in light of the economic downturn after the COVID, or as they're still going through the COVID in many cases.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","125":"Hiebert: And I think he had had several agendas. One is to show that China cared in the midst of the still continuing difficulties, like in Malaysia with COVID.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","126":"Hiebert: He had some meetings, virtual meetings, but with Southeast Asian foreign ministers, but he hadn't really toured. And so now he went to the 5 mainland Southeast Asian countries, and to 5 other mainland Southeast Asian countries plus Singapore.","127":"Hiebert on China Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s trip to some Southeast Asian countries: It's always hard to measure what a trip achieves, like a few days after the ends, but I think he was coming for various reasons. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/OAN7Xo4y6p","128":"Read our latest #WeatherAlert here: https:\/\/t.co\/SJ6GZ7MP5u","129":"LOOK: Roberto Pasamba shares a photo of waist-deep floodwaters at Rosario St., Lopez, Quezon at around 9:16 am on Tuesday, October 20.
