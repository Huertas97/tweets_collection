You don't lose those customers, because they've got nowhere else they can go.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","118":"Collins: There are other aspects of the business model as well, which areI think companies like Facebook are, are actually I think, increasingly involved in abuse of market power.  \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","119":"Collins: The business model of the attention economy is directing content people regardless of how harmful the content is. That's what I think you can change. You could use that same technology to do good.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","120":"Collins: We can't have a system where it's consistently Facebook only respond to stuff that's brought to their attention. We need them to be proactive and make these decisions rather than being asked to do it.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","121":"Collins: There need to be some rules of the road for this, but I definitely think the real Facebook Oversight Board helps shine a light on some of these issues.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","122":"Collins: How effective they were doing it is another matter, but the fact they made that step, I don't think that's something they would have done unless they'd come into that, that sort of scrutiny and pressure. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","123":"Collins: I think the intervention they made in saying they would get rid of groups related to the conspiracy network. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","124":"Collins: But they're also at times quite thin-skinned as well. I think what we saw in the run up to the election, I think the [board] played a role in this was the kind of naming and shaming of things that were happening on Facebook that they've done nothing about.","125":"Collins on the effectiveness of the Real Facebook Oversight Board on the US election: It has an effect\u2026. They're dismissive of criticism at some on some levels, I believe that they operate almost above any government in the world.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","126":"Collins: Facebook says they remove 95% of harmful content reported to them. But no one knows whether that's true or not. They have never been audited. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","127":"Collins: And this is really important as well, because on the whole, we are largely reliant on self-declared information from the tech companies. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","128":"Collins: For me, this is not about censoring speech, although I think we all recognize that there's always been a line between people's right to speak freely, and the harm that that speech can cause other people. That's always something that we've recognized in law.","129":"Collins: Also part of it is the idea that there is some content, which is not necessarily illegal, but is harmful. I would say like, medical disinformation. Isn't it an example of that?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","130":"Collins: The next important step in the UK Government is publishing an online house bill\u2026. What the house bill will do is to establish a duty, a legal duty of care responsibilities for tech companies towards their users, and define what that means.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","131":"Collins: We should not only take an interest in what's going on in these countries, but we should understand that the same thing will happen here, too. Let's do something about it.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","132":"Collins:  I think there's a real danger that disinformation is used on social media...to direct aggression towards enemies of the state and people that speak out with different voices.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","133":"Collins: It can be used to flood out real journalism and proper news, and leave people in a position where they don't really know what to believe anymore.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","134":"Collins: I think [the Philippines] is a good example of what happens when you have a society in which Facebook does not just become a popular tool, but almost becomes the internet.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","135":"Collins: Whilst we have an interest in legislating in our individual countries, I think we should try and set some global standards for these companies to adhere to, just as we have in financial services and America has its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","136":"Collins: We felt clearly that the big tech companies need to come under the umbrella or some form of regulation, it can't just be down to Mark Zuckerberg to determine whether disinformation is harmful enough \u2014 that it should be challenged and removed.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","137":"Collins: There's a certain menace to them in a way, if you question them or challenge them, their initial response is one of disregard, and then dismissal.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","138":"Collins: We call the big tech company \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d in the final report. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","139":"Collins: Rather than having to start from scratch, you can work with us, you can benefit from what we've discovered already, and you can be part of our future hearings. And so that's how the international grand committee has evolved.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","140":"Collins: [The forum] was something that parliamentarians anywhere in the world could plug into. And we'd get approached by people in different countries who were investigating Russian disinformation, or the work of Cambridge Analytica, or just asking questions about Facebook.","141":"Collins: The first session was held in London, really as a kind of extension of the committee inquiry that I was running, which is on disinformation. And we gathered together a group of 26 different parliamentarians from nine different countries.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","142":"Collins: And I said, if Mark Zuckerberg says he can't come to every committee in the world, then why don't we get together in one place and invite him to come to give evidence to us collectively?\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","143":"Collins: We tried to get [Zuckerberg] to come to the UK to give evidence to us, and he refused to do it. And he sent other quite senior people from the company, but he wouldn't come himself.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","144":"Collins: We then sort of got the phase when Mark Zuckerberg agreed to give evidence to the United States Congress. And he then held the sort of on the record, but private meeting in the European Parliament with representatives there. \n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","145":"Collins: I thought it was quite interesting. People taking evidence on one committee hearing and using it in another and Facebook didn't like it at all.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","146":"Collins: We questioned Facebook, specifically on Cambridge Analytica and the first time they've been asked about it in a hearing. And this was about a month or so before the big Cambridge Analytica story sort of hit the international news. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","147":"Collins: We started to work with other Parliament's around the world. We're investigating the same issues. I decided that we would hold the hearings with the tech companies with Google, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","148":"Collins: The algorithms that drive that process don't seem to be that discriminating about the sort of content they direct people towards. And that is a design issue within social media that needs to be addressed.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","149":"Collins: There is a design issue within companies like Facebook, which is that they are designed through analyzing users' data, to promote content to them, to engage their attention for as long as possible. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","150":"Collins: We recognize as we got deeper into this investigation that this wasn't just about content, it was also about the problem of disinformation.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","151":"Collins: I think we really thought about fake news as being a content problem on social media. And people were generating this, this bad content, and the social media companies perhaps needed to do more to more actively remove it. \n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","152":"Collins: As you will know, there's a lot more to being a democracy than holding elections, that the citizens making informed choices based on information and facts is really important.\n\n#RapplerTalk: https:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","153":"Collins: So we thought we would look at that as an investigation. And the digital culture, media and sport committee looked at a whole range of issues to do with media regulation, and broadcasting and freedom of the press.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/SeFwNsggUu","154":"Collins: There's also been some analysis done on disinformation on Facebook during that election campaign as well.
