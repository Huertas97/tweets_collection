It also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. https:\/\/t.co\/ByJ5eDZugL","1":"Each antibody in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen. When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce enough antibodies specific to that antigen. https:\/\/t.co\/aae05uoOQN","2":"A pathogen can cause disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts called an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen\u2019s antigen are an important part of the immune system. https:\/\/t.co\/D6PTyx0MdL","3":"When a pathogen or disease enters our body, it introduces a new antigen. For every new antigen, our body\u2019s defence, called the immune system, is triggered to build specific antibodies that can grab onto the antigen to defeat the pathogen. Want to learn more?
