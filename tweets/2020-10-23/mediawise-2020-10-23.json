How confident do you feel about avoiding misinformation on #Election2020?","7":"All of these fact-checks show us that you REALLY need to fact-check what politicians say, especially when their claims conflict with one another. An easy way to do this is to practice lateral reading, a strategy developed by @SHEG_stanford.  Here\u2019s how to do it: https:\/\/t.co\/r8fn6fhc3i","8":"To learn more about who is donating to the campaigns, watch @JessicaYellin explain how to follow the money in politics. https:\/\/t.co\/DZtdaeYjb6","9":"According to @OpenSecretsDC, @JoeBiden has received $8 million from PACs and individuals working in the securities and investments industry and @realDonaldTrump has received $2.3 million. So, it\u2019s inaccurate to say Trump does not accept money from Wall Street. https:\/\/t.co\/h0zORa312L","10":"Candidates made conflicting claims about donors from Wall Street. @realDonaldTrump said he doesn\u2019t take money from Wall Street, but @JoeBiden does. This is FALSE, @FactCheckDotOrg says they both accept money from the securities and investments industry. https:\/\/t.co\/pNu1SgQAL8","11":"On the topic of masks, @JoeBiden said he encourages mask wearing. @realDonaldTrump claimed that Dr. Anthony Fauci said not to wear masks. We\u2019ve debunked this claim before. Dr. Fauci said this back in March when there was a shortage of masks. He currently recommends mask wearing. https:\/\/t.co\/89os9hag7u","12":"FACT: About 4 million Americans\u2019 insurance plans were cancelled because they did not meet the requirements set by the ACA. Although many people found insurance elsewhere, millions of people were still forced to look for different health insurance plans. https:\/\/t.co\/TCY4LUISFD","13":"On healthcare, the candidates debated the effects of the Affordable Care Act. @JoeBiden claimed no one lost their health insurance under the ACA, but @realDonaldTrump disagreed. Joe Biden\u2019s claim is FALSE and was @PolitiFact\u2019s Lie of the Year in 2013. https:\/\/t.co\/DYFwOaZ9oL https:\/\/t.co\/R6g9F3PYT6","14":"@PolitiFact says @realDonaldTrump\u2019s claim about rounding the corner is FALSE.

So which is it? https:\/\/t.co\/h4b5vK53dc","16":"There were a lot of conflicting claims said during #Debates2020 last night.
